# Website-Licitatie-Picturi
This Website has 6 functional pages: 
  - A main page, where we would have the basic info and a pill-shaped menu
  - Login page
  - Signup page
  - Forgot password page
  - Contact page ( contact form with dynamic page )
  - Listing page

  - The Backend is connected trough an API to MongoDB ( the original purpose was that The LOGIN form take credentials from an online data base)

All the pages above are to prove what my skills using HTML, CSS and Javascript are, and not meant for actual use, as the website is not yet populated with products nor information.
